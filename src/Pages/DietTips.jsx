                It is good to try out the BMI calculator once in a while to keep
                track of your weight. However, relying on BMI alone is not
                advisable..
              </p>

              <p>
                As you know, with age, you are bound to lose muscle mass and
                bone density, and start accumulating more body fat. Factually,
                when compared to men, women carry greater fat content. One of
                the biggest flaws of BMI is that it does not differentiate
                between body fat and muscle mass.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your BMI might be skewed. So, you need to keep a track of your
                BMI in conjunction with the following enhances accuracy for your
                weight management regimen.

                <b>1. Waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR)</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally, your waist circumference should measure less than your
                hips. WHR more than 0.90 in men and 0.85 in women indicates
                higher fat deposition around the waist which increases risk of
                chronic diseases.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                This ratio is obtained by dividing waist size by height. If your
                waist circumference is more than half your height that makes you
                obese in the middle.
              </p>

                <b>3. Body fat percentage</b>

                The measure calculates the fat content in your body which is
                best determined in consultation with your nutritionist and
                fitness coach.

                Where you store your body fat is decided by your genes. Normally
                men accumulate fat on their bellies while women on hips, butt or
                thighs
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that you know about it, you are in a better position to
