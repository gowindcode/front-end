                India ranks in the top 5 countries globally for obese adults,
                with 30 million obese adults.
              </li>
              <li>
                That is about the same as the population of Mumbai, Delhi and
                Bengaluru combined. India has the second highest number of obese
                children. 14.4 million obese children.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thatâ€™s about the same as the population of Chennai, Pune and
                Hyderabad combined. The equivalent of the population of Mumbai +
                Delhi + Bengaluru + Pune + Chennai + Hyderabad is now obese.

            <u>And this has consequences:</u>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>India</b> is now widely recognized as the
            <b>â€˜Diabetes capital of the worldâ€™</b>. Really worried ðŸ˜Œ to hear
            about Diabetes capital. Diabetes is reaching potentially epidemic
            proportions in <b>India</b>. It is predicted that by 2030 Diabetes
            may afflict up to 80 million individuals in <b>India</b>. Thatâ€™s
            about double the numbers expected in China (42m) and the United
            States (30m). And it looks like <b>India</b> is not too far behind
            in the number of people with hypertension (blood pressure) either.
            These might seem like just numbers, but think about your family and
            friends. Do you know someone with either diabetes, fatty liver,
            blood pressure, thyroid problems or excess weight? Itâ€™s likely you
            know one or more such people. We all do, and these numbers add up to
            a lot. And itâ€™s starting to have an effect on the next generation
            too. And if we see a little of this, doctors see a lot of it. Iâ€™ve
            spent a lot of time talking to doctors, many of whom recommend
            Daily9 health coaching to their patients. Their stories are
            sobering. In short, this is what I hear from them: Diabetes,
            thyroid, fatty liver and other lifestyle diseases have become the
            new normal. These and other diseases that usually occurred after the
            age of 50 are now appearing from the 20s. So the next time you hear
            that <b>healthcare</b> is a booming sector in <b>India</b>, you know
            why. We have an <b>increasing number of sick people</b>. And itâ€™s
            only getting worse.{" "}
